# flatcam-qt6

This repo is an attempt to use Qt6 with the original FlatCAM code. Some additional pieces from various
other forks have been included.


## FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing

The original code is (c) 2014-2015 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

## Qt6 & Python3

Qt4 is no longer easily available in Python and as the current version is Qt6 it made sense to jump to that. Additionally the version of vispy that was advised was quite old, so this now aims to build using the currently available vispy version.

Additionally, no effort has been made to make this work with Python 2. It is intended as Python3 only.

## Building

The intent is, as far as possible, to allow this to build using

```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running

Presently it's just started via the simple

```shell
$ python ./FlatCAM.py
```

## Bugs

Many. It's a large amount of code and various parts don't seem to work or don't seem to work quite correctly. Pull requests more than welcome!
